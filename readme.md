# vctr
> Minimal operations for two-dimensional vectors

In two dimensions, a vector can be represented by a map with the two fields `x` and `y`. This module contains a few small functions for manipulating these kinds of objects.

## install
```sh
npm install vctr
```

## usage
```js
const { add, subtract, ... } = require('vctr')
```

### `add(a, b)`
Returns the sum of the two provided vectors.

### `subtract(a, b)`
Returns the difference between the two provided vectors.

### `multiply(a, b)`
Returns the product of the two provided vectors. The second argument may be a scalar quantity (a `Number`) if desired.

### `divide(a, b)`
Returns the quotient of the two provided vectors. The second argument may be a scalar quantity (a `Number`) if desired.

### `direction(vector)`
Calculates the direction in which `vector` is pointing, in radians.

### `magnitude(vector)`
Calculates the distance covered by `vector`.
